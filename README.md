### Rare ANA Detection


####  **Announcement** 

Regarding the issues related to open datasets and code, we have the following considerations and plans: 

1) Considerations regarding intellectual property rights: The proposed research scheme, dataset, and code for this project have been applied for a Chinese national invention patent. The application was submitted and accepted in May of this year and is in the review process (Application number: 202310612311.2) (https://www.cnipa.gov.cn/). The acceptance letter of the application can been see the figure.



                      ![our application letter](https://foruda.gitee.com/images/1700188238865661940/503373c2_11573942.png "屏幕截图")     
                            
  We discuss this issue with our intellectual property attorney and patent agent. Publicizing the code could potentially lead to loss of patent rights, as patent offices require that patent applications not be disclosed before publication. 
We would be pleased to publicly share our dataset and code to increase the impact of our work, as long as our rights are protected (obtaining our patent certificate from the government). I hope to receive your understanding.

2) Considerations of the ownership and privacy protection of data in the medical system: Although there were no ethical issues with our study. We still need to comply with the relevant conditions of Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine on the management of medical system privacy and data disclosure. Before obtaining permission, we do not have the authority to disclose the dataset.

3) Considerations regarding commercialization and outcomes transformation: This project has significant clinical translational value. Initially, we did not consider making the code and dataset public for fear that some teams may exploit our findings for commercial purposes. Currently, INOVA, EUROIMMUNE, AESKU, and other in vitro diagnostic companies are committed to developing similar products for commercial conversion once they enter the clinical field. We have this concern in the absence of invention patent protection.
